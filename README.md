# HBNSSI timings

This directory contains resources necessary for generating exact event timings for the Healthy Brain Network - Serial Scanning Initative (HBNSSI) Flanker task.

Included are source files from the [HBNSSI data portal](https://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/hbn_ssi/),
as well as a Python script for creating BIDS-compatible event files.
